# gitignore-wordpress

My default gitignore for WordPress projects.
This will ignore configs, user uploaded content (images) and select sensitive files.

## Installation
Copy the [.gitignore](https://github.com/shapedigital/gitignore-wordpress/blob/main/.gitignore) file in this repo to the root of your new WordPress project.

## Usage
Add this file before your initial commit, when first setting the project up.
